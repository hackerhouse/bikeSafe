    <p>By working together and sharing information, we can reduce bike theft 
in the city of San Francisco and beyond. Volunteer to register and photograph your
bicycle, and if it is ever stolen, it can be more easily returned to you.</p>
<p>You should also consider subscribing to the theft and sentinel feeds, which will let you
know when a bike has been stolen, or is being locked up for a time, nearby. By quickly responding to a theft, the bike can be recovered, and the perpetrator caught, much more likely than if days pass before the crime is publicised. The sentinel feed lets you know when a bike is being locked up nearby, so you can keep an eye on it for your fellow cyclist.</p>
